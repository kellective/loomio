      %p
        Loomio is a #{link_to('cooperative social enterprise', about_path)}, working to make everyday democracy accessible to as many people as possible.
        To achieve this vision we’re developing an ethical payment model to resource the software development.

      %p
        It’s really useful for us to know what types of groups want to use Loomio, and what kind of payment model works best for them. Which of the two options below would best fit your group?

      = f.input :cannot_contribute,
        collection: {"<strong>Subscription:</strong><br/> Established groups and organisations will pay a regular monthly subscription".html_safe => false,
                     "<strong>Pay what you can:</strong><br/> If your group doesn’t have a formal budget, your group members will be invited to make a voluntary contribution.".html_safe => true},
                as: :radio_buttons, label: ""

      %p
        This isn’t a commitment to pay, just useful information to help us design our model. Thanks!
